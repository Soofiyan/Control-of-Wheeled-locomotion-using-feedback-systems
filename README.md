# Control of Wheeled locomotion using feedback systems
 In this repository I have listed all the control system for wheeled locomotion.

# 3 wheel drive with magnetometer
   3 wheeled holonomous robot which is controlled by a magnetometer which gives yaw. We have also used encoders in X and Y direction to get the location of the robot in world co-ordinates. Thus we get the angle and x, y co-ordinates. Thus I have used LQR controller for controlling the distance and also the angle at which the bot has to traverse.

# fence following
  In this project I have used 3 wheeled holonomous robot which follows the fence using 2 ultrasound sensor and used LQR for control.

# Line following using 3 wheeled robot
   In this project I have used LQR controller to control the bot along the line and also used TCRT sensor which is a wavelength based sensor, which changes its value according to the change in colour.

# Ultrasound alignment
  In this project we have used ultrasound which is use to align the 3 wheel holonomous drive to any width or any corner using 2 ultrasound sensor.
